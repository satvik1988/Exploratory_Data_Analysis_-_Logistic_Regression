(solver='lbfgs' stands for Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm, which is a quasi-Newton method that approximates the second-       order Hessian matrix of the objective function being minimized. It is commonly used as an optimization algorithm for smooth, unconstrained optimization problems that have a large number of variables.)
